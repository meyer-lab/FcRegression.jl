# [Mixed IgG Fc immune complexes exhibit blended binding profiles and refine FcR affinity estimates](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(23)00745-3)

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies coordinate immune effector responses by interacting with effector cells via fragment crystallizable γ (Fcγ) receptors. The IgG Fc domain directs effector responses through subclass and glycosylation variation. Although each Fc variant has been extensively characterized in isolation, during immune responses, IgG is almost always produced in Fc mixtures. How this influences effector responses has not been examined. Here, we measure Fcγ receptor binding to mixed Fc immune complexes. Binding of these mixtures falls along a continuum between pure cases and quantitatively matches a mechanistic model, except for several low-affinity interactions mostly involving IgG2. We find that the binding model provides refined estimates of their affinities. Finally, we demonstrate that the model predicts effector cell-elicited platelet depletion in humanized mice. Contrary to previous views, IgG2 exhibits appreciable binding through avidity, though it is insufficient to induce effector responses. Overall, this work demonstrates a quantitative framework for modeling mixed IgG Fc-effector cell regulation.

## Highlights

- Mixed Fc immune complexes bind as a blend of each constituent IgG species
- A multivalent binding model can be generalized to mixed Fc immune complexes
- Immune complexes provide better estimates for low IgG-Fcγ receptor affinities
- The FcγR binding model predicts effector-elicited cell clearance in humanized mice

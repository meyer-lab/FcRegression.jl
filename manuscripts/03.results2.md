### Heterovalent Immune Complex Binding does not Always Vary Monotonically 

Previous work has shown that an increase in immune complex (IC) valency often causes an increase in human FcgR-IgG binding when a single human IgG (hIgG) subclass is used [@DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2018.05.018]. We wished to see if this would also be true when ICs consist of a mixture of two hIgG subclasses. Analogous to previous work, we assessed the binding of ICs presenting two of four hIgG subclasses to cells expressing one of six hFcgRs at a single IC concentration of 1e-9 M. These binding measurements utilized a panel of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, each stably expressing a single hFcgR species. While the IC concentration stayed the same, the binding measurements were taken from ICs developed with various hIgG mixture compositions: 0%, 10%, 33%, 66%, 90%, and 100% of IgGx. This process was performed for ICs with average valencies of both 4 and 33, assembled by covalently attaching 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) to BSA (see STAR Methods). Anti-TNP antibody mixtures of differing hIgG subclasses were bound to the BSA complexes before treatment. The measured binding and variation in binding followed consistent patterns with variation as a function of hIgG subclass, mixture composition, hFcgR, and valency (Lux et al., 2013) (Figure 1). Higher valency corresponded with greater binding which is to be expected. However, there was not a monotonic increase or decrease in binding in all cases, suggesting that there may be some synergistic or antagonistic properties of hIgG mixtures on IC binding.

### Accurately account for mixed immune complexes

- Introduction of the computational model
- Introduction of mixture binding experiment, show some sample results (all in SI)

Using our mechanistic binding model, we can accurately predict in-vitro binding of IC mixtures to human FcgRs. Monovalent affinites, IC composition and concentrations, receptor densities, and crosslinking constant are all accounted for when predicting in-vitro binding.

### Predicting in-vivo effect

To model the in-vivo effects of polyclonal antibody responses, we extended a simple, equilibrium binding model we previously used to model antibody effector response [@pmid:29960887]. Briefly, immune complexes are assumed to bind to FcγRs on the cell surface with monovalent binding kinetics, and then can engage additional receptors with a propensity proportional to their affinity ([@fig:bindingS]A). Effector cell binding then leads to target cell killing. We reimplemented our previous model of antibody-elicited melanoma cell clearance in addition to an ITP model. 

Building upon our earlier implementation, we refined how uncertainty is handled in the regression between binding and target cell clearance. We calculate an "activity" based on the calculated amount of multimerized activating and inhibitory FcγR with each treatment. This is then regressed against each treatment's observed target cell depletion ([@fig:regression]a). Target cell depletion is a saturable process (one cannot get rid of more than 100% of cells) in addition to each target cell having an equal risk of clearance, so we switched from a previously used `tanh` relationship to an exponential relationship to account for this effect [@pmid:29960887]. Also, our model can predict cell weights that reinforce what we already know to be true: that Kupffer cells play an important role in platelet depletion "Citation".

### Validate in-vivo effects of mixtures

- Analyze synergy in binding, cell activity, and overall depletion (Do we have cytokine secretion data?)
- Probably more analysis in the discussion section
- May have ITP validation results from Nimmerjahn

Once the binding, activity, and depletion weights have been calculated this model enables us to predict the binding outcome for immune complexes formed from mixtures of antibodies, and ask whether these mixtures have distinct properties from either single-antibody complex ([@fig:bindingS]B). We defined synergy or antagonism in the mixture's effects as a difference from the additive combination of each single antibody case.

### Quantifying synergy with varying model parameters

 With this model, we could identify predicted cases of synergistic or antagonistic binding or predicted effector response in effector cells ([@fig:bindingS]D/E). Responses generally deviated from additivity at higher concentrations and valency of immune complexes ([@fig:bindingS]F/G). This trend is consistent with the observation that non-additive interactions do not arise in the limit of small amounts of receptor binding (TODO). As expected, we observed little effect of proportional variation in receptor abundance ([@fig:bindingS]H). In total, this expanded model of antibody-FcγR interaction allows us to predict whether antibodies might have similar or distinct effects when present in combination.

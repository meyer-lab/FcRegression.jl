## Methods

### Generalized multi-ligand, multi-receptor multivalent binding model

To allow us to model the binding consequences of polyclonal antibody mixtures, we extended our previous binding model to account for immune complexes with mixed Fc composition [@pmid:29960887].




According to the model, with a single receptor and ligand species, the number of ligands bound $i$-valently to the cell at equilibrium, $v_{i,eq}$, can be found using the relation

$$v_{i,eq} = \binom{f}{i} (K_x)^{i-1} L_0 K_a R_{eq}^i$$

## Methods

### Generalized multi-ligand, multi-receptor multivalent binding model

To allow us to model the binding consequences of polyclonal antibody mixtures, we extended our previous binding model to account for immune complexes with mixed Fc composition [@pmid:29960887].





### In-Vivo Regression

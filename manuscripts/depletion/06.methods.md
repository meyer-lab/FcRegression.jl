### Generalized multi-ligand, multi-receptor multivalent binding model

To allow us to model the binding consequences of polyclonal antibody mixtures, we extended our previous binding model to account for immune complexes with mixed IgG composition [@pmid:29960887].

Assume we have $N_L$ types of monomer ligands and $N_R$ type of receptors. The association constant of the initial monovalent binding between ligand $i$ and receptor $j$ is $K_{a,ij}$. Due to steric effect on the ligand complexes, any subsequent binding after the initial one through crosslinking between ligand $i$ and receptor $j$ will have association constant $K_x^* K_{a,ij}$, which is proportional to their corresponding monovalent binding constant. The concentration of complexes is $L_0$, and the complexes consist of various ligand monomers. The proportion of ligand $i$ in all monomers is $C_i$. By this setup, we know that $\sum_{i=1}^{N_L} C_i = 1$. Let $R_{\mathrm{tot},i}$ be the total number of receptor $i$ expressed on the cell surface, and $R_{\mathrm{eq},i}$ be the number of unbound receptor $i$ on that cell at the equilibrium state during the ligand complex-receptor interaction.


The binding configuration at the equilibrium state between an individual complex and a cell expressing various receptors can be described as a vector $\mathbf{q} = (q_{1,0}, q_{1,1}, ..., q_{1,N_R}, q_{2,0},..., q_{2,N_R},q_{3,0},..., q_{N_L, N_R})$ of length $N_L(N_R+1)$, where $q_{i,j}$ is the number of ligand $i$ bound to receptor $j$, and $q_{i,0}$ is the number of unbound ligand $i$ on that complex in this configuration. The sum of elements in $\mathbf{q}$ is equal to $f$ , the effective avidity. For all $i$ in $\{1,2,..., N_L\}$, let $φ_{i,j} = R_{\mathrm{eq},j} K_{a,ij} K_x^* C_i$ when $j$ is in $\{1,2,...,N_R\}$, and $φ_{i,0} = C_i$. The relative amount of complexes in the configuration described by $\mathbf{q}$ at equilibrium is

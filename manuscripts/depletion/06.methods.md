### Generalized multi-ligand, multi-receptor multivalent binding model

To model polyclonal antibody immune complexes (ICs), we extended our previous binding model to account for ICs of mixed IgG composition [@pmid:29960887].

We define $N_L$ as the number of distinct monomer Fcs, $N_R$ the number of FcRs, and the association constant of monovalent Fc-FcR binding between Fc $i$ and FcR $j$ as $K_{a,ij}$. Multivalent binding interactions after the initial interaction have an association constant of $K_x^* K_{a,ij}$, proportional to their corresponding monovalent affinity. The concentration of complexes is $L_0$, and the complexes consist of random ligand monomer assortments accoring to their relative proportion. The proportion of ligand $i$ in all monomers is $C_i$. By this setup, we know $\sum_{i=1}^{N_L} C_i = 1$. $R_{\mathrm{tot},i}$ is the total number of receptor $i$ expressed on the cell surface, and $R_{\mathrm{eq},i}$ the number of unbound receptors $i$ on a cell at the equilibrium state during the ligand complex-receptor interaction.

The binding configuration at the equilibrium state between an individual complex and a cell expressing various receptors can be described as a vector $\mathbf{q} = (q_{1,0}, q_{1,1}, ..., q_{1,N_R}, q_{2,0},..., q_{2,N_R},q_{3,0},..., q_{N_L, N_R})$ of length $N_L(N_R+1)$, where $q_{i,j}$ is the number of ligand $i$ bound to receptor $j$, and $q_{i,0}$ is the number of unbound ligand $i$ on that complex in this configuration. The sum of elements in $\mathbf{q}$ is equal to $f$ , the effective avidity. For all $i$ in $\{1,2,..., N_L\}$, let $φ_{i,j} = R_{\mathrm{eq},j} K_{a,ij} K_x^* C_i$ when $j$ is in $\{1,2,...,N_R\}$, and $φ_{i,0} = C_i$. The relative amount of complexes in the configuration described by $\mathbf{q}$ at equilibrium is

{% raw %}
$$v_{\mathbf{q},eq} = \binom{f}{\mathbf{q}} \frac{L_0}{K_x^* } \prod_{i=1\\ j=0}^{i=N_L\\ j=N_R}{{φ_{ij}}^{q_{ij}}},$$
{% endraw %}

with $\binom{f}{\mathbf{q}}$ being the multinomial coefficient. Then the total relative amount of bound receptor type $n$ at equilibrium is

{% raw %}
$$ R_{\mathrm{bound},n} = \frac{L_0 f}{K_x^* } \sum_{m=0}^{N_L}φ_{mn} \left(\sum_{i=1\\ j=0}^{i=N_L\\ j=N_R}{{φ_{ij}}^{q_{ij}}}\right)^{f-1} .$$
{% endraw %}

By conservation of mass, we know that $R_{\mathrm{tot},n} = R_{\mathrm{eq},n} + R_{\mathrm{bound},n}$ for each receptor type $n$, while $R_{\mathrm{bound},n}$ is a function of $R_{\mathrm{eq},n}$. Therefore, each $R_{\mathrm{eq},n}$ can be solved numerically from its $R_{\mathrm{tot},n}$ measured experimentally. Similarly, the total relative amount of complexes bind to at least one receptor on the cell is

{% raw %}
$$ L_{\mathrm{bound}} = \frac{L_0}{K_x^* } \left [\left(\sum_{i=1\\ j=0}^{i=N_L\\ j=N_R}{{φ_{ij}}^{q_{ij}}}\right)^f -1 \right] .$$
{% endraw %}

FcRs are activated through crosslinking. The amount of each kind of receptor in a multimerized complex can be calculated as

{% raw %}
$$R_{\mathrm{multi},n} = \frac{L_0 f}{K_x^* } \sum_{m=0}^{N_L}φ_{mn} \left[\left(\sum_{i=1\\ j=0}^{i=N_L\\ j=N_R}{{φ_{ij}}^{q_{ij}}}\right)^{f-1}-1 \right] .$$
{% endraw %}

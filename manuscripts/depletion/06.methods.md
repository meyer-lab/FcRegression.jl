### Generalized multi-ligand, multi-receptor multivalent binding model

To allow us to model the binding consequences of polyclonal antibody mixtures, we extended our previous binding model to account for immune complexes with mixed IgG composition [@pmid:29960887].


Assume we have $N_L$ types of monomer ligands and $N_R$ type of receptors. The association constant of the initial monovalent binding between ligand $i$ and receptor $j$ is $K_{a,ij}$. Due to steric effect on the ligand complexes, any subsequent binding after the initial one through crosslinking between ligand $i$ and receptor $j$ will have association constant $K_x^* K_{a,ij}$, which is proportional to their corresponding monovalent binding constant. The concentration of complexes is $L_0$, and the complexes consist of various ligand monomers. The proportion of ligand $i$ in all monomers is $C_i$. By this setup, we know that $\sum_{i=1}^{N_L} C_i = 1$. Let $R_{\mathrm{tot},i}$ be the total number of receptor $i$ expressed on the cell surface, and $R_{\mathrm{eq},i}$ be the number of unbound receptor $i$ on that cell at the equilibrium state during the ligand complex-receptor interaction.


The binding configuration at the equilibrium state between an individual complex and a cell expressing various receptors can be described as a vector $\mathbf{q} = (q_{1,0}, q_{1,1}, ..., q_{1,N_R}, q_{2,0},..., q_{2,N_R},q_{3,0},..., q_{N_L, N_R})$ of length $N_L(N_R+1)$, where $q_{i,j}$ is the number of ligand $i$ bound to receptor $j$, and $q_{i,0}$ is the number of unbound ligand $i$ on that complex in this configuration. The sum of elements in $\mathbf{q}$ is equal to $f$ , the effective avidity. For all $i$ in $\{1,2,..., N_L\}$, let $φ_{i,j} = R_{\mathrm{eq},j} K_{a,ij} K_x^* C_i$ when $j$ is in $\{1,2,...,N_R\}$, and $φ_{i,0} = C_i$. The relative amount of complexes in the configuration described by $\mathbf{q}$ at equilibrium is

$$v_{\mathbf{q},eq} = \binom{f}{\mathbf{q}} \frac{L_0}{K_x^* } \prod_{i=1\\ j=0}^{i=N_L\\ j=N_R}{{φ_{ij}}^{q_{ij}}},$$

with $\binom{f}{\mathbf{q}}$ being the multinomial coefficient. Then the total relative amount of bound receptor type $n$ at equilibrium is

$$ R_{\mathrm{bound},n} = \frac{L_0 f}{K_x^* } \sum_{m=0}^{N_L}φ_{mn} \left(\sum_{i=1\\ j=0}^{i=N_L\\ j=N_R}{{φ_{ij}}^{q_{ij}}}\right)^{f-1} .$$

By the conservation of mass, we know that $R_{\mathrm{tot},n} = R_{\mathrm{eq},n} + R_{\mathrm{bound},n}$ for each receptor type $n$, while $R_{\mathrm{bound},n}$ is a function of $R_{\mathrm{eq},n}$. Therefore, each $R_{\mathrm{eq},n}$ can be solved numerically from its $R_{\mathrm{tot},n}$ measured experimentally. Similarly, the total relative amount of complexes bind to at least one receptor on the cell is

$$ L_{\mathrm{bound}} = \frac{L_0}{K_x^* } \left [\left(\sum_{i=1\\ j=0}^{i=N_L\\ j=N_R}{{φ_{ij}}^{q_{ij}}}\right)^f -1 \right] .$$

Since the Fc receptor can only be activated with crosslinked receptors, the relative amounts of each kind of receptors multimerized are of interest, and they can be calculated as

$$R_{\mathrm{multi},n} = \frac{L_0 f}{K_x^* } \sum_{m=0}^{N_L}φ_{mn} \left[\left(\sum_{i=1\\ j=0}^{i=N_L\\ j=N_R}{{φ_{ij}}^{q_{ij}}}\right)^{f-1}-1 \right] .$$



### Generalized multivalent binding model with nonrandom complexes

When the complexes are particularly engineered and not randomly formed by ligand monomers, the proportions of each kind of complexes become exogenous variables and are no longer decided by the monomer composition $C_i$'s. The monomer composition of a ligand complex can be represented by a vector $\mathbf{θ} = (θ_1, θ_2, ..., θ_{N_L})$, where each $θ_i$ is the number of monomer ligand type $i$ on that complex. Let $C_{\mathbf{θ}}$ be the proportion of the $\mathbf{θ}$ complexes in all ligand complexes, and $Θ$ be the set of all possible $\mathbf{θ}$'s. We have $\sum_{\mathbf{θ} \in \Theta} C_{\mathbf{θ}} = 1$.

The binding between a ligand complex and a cell expressing several types of receptors can still be represented by a series of $q_{ij}$ aforementioned. The relationship between $q_{ij}$'s and $θ_i$ is given by $θ_i = q_{i0} + q_{i1} + ... + q_{iN_R}$. Let the vector $\mathbf{q}_i = (q_{i0}, q_{i1}, ..., q_{iN_R})$, and the corresponding $\mathbf{θ}$ of a binding configuration $\mathbf{q}$ be $\mathbf{θ}(\mathbf{q})$. For all $i$ in $\{1,2,...,N_L\}$, define $ψ_{ij} = R_{\mathrm{eq},j} K_{a,ij} K_x^*$ when $j$ is in $\{1,2,...,N_R\}$ and $ψ_{i0} = 1$. The relative amount of complexes bound to a cell with configuration $\mathbf{q}$ at equilibrium is

$$v_{\mathbf{q},eq} = \frac{L_0 C_{\mathbf{θ}(\mathbf{q})}}{K_x^* }
\prod_{i=1\\j=0}^{i=N_L\\ j=N_R} {ψ_{ij}}^{q_{ij}}
\prod_{i=1}^{N_L} \binom{θ_i}{\mathbf{q}_i} .$$

Then we can calculate the relative amount of bound receptor $n$ as
$$
R_{\mathrm{bound},n} = \frac{L_0}{K_x^* } \sum_{\mathbf{θ} \in Θ} C_{\mathbf{θ}}
\left[ \sum_{i=1}^{N_L} \frac{ψ_{in} θ_i}{\sum_{j=0}^{N_R} ψ_{ij}} \right]
\prod_{i=1}^{N_L} \left( \sum_{j=0}^{N_R} ψ_{ij}\right)^{θ_i} .
$$

By $R_{\mathrm{tot},n} = R_{\mathrm{eq},n} + R_{\mathrm{bound},n}$, we can solve $R_{\mathrm{eq},n}$ numerically for each type of receptor.

The total relative amount of ligands bound at equilibrium is

$$ L_{\mathrm{bound}} =  \frac{L_0}{K_x^* } \sum_{\mathbf{θ} \in Θ} C_{\mathbf{θ}}
\left[ \prod_{i=1}^{N_L} \left( \sum_{j=0}^{N_R} ψ_{ij}\right)^{θ_i} -1 \right] .$$

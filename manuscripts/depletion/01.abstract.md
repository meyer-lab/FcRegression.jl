## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Antibodies are crucial and central regulators of the immune response. Those of the IgG isotype interact with Fc gamma receptors on effector cells. The effector response of IgGs encompasses multiple cell types (e.g., macrophages, monocytes, etc.) and multiple processes (e.g., antigen presentation, cytokine response, phagocytosis, etc.). An individual IgG can be either pro- or anti-inflammatory depending upon its Fc domain composition and the context. IgGs are particularly versatile agents for therapeutic treatment due to their immunotherapeutic effects as well as those of direct antigen binding and opsonization. Indeed, IgG molecules comprise a broad range of approved therapies, many of which are known to rely in part on effector cell response. At the same time, the multiplicity throughout—of constant region composition, Fc gamma receptors, cell populations, and antigen binding in combination—makes precisely understanding, measuring, and manipulating effector function a yet-elusive goal.

## Summary points

- A equilibrium, multivalent binding model can be extended to incorporate hetero-valent complexes and cells of mixed receptor expression.
- An FcγR binding model predicts effector-elicited cell killing across multiple disease models.
- Simple corrections can account for non-cellular (complement and neutralization) antibody effects.
- Model comparison can identify differences in essential effector cell populations.

## Introduction

Here is where the introduction goes.

Here, we build upon our earlier model development in two key ways. First, we evaluate the ability of a multi-valent binding model to predict effector cell-elicited clearance across a panel of disease models. Second, we extend our multivalent binding model to hetero-valent immune complex mixtures. This demonstrates the generality of modeling effector response through a mechanistic binding model, and enables predictions for polyclonal antibody responses.

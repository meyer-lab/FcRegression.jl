To model the effects of polyclonal antibody responses, we extended a simple, equilibrium binding model we previously used to model antibody effector response [@pmid:29960887]. Briefly, immune complexes are assumed to bind to FcγRs on the cell surface with monovalent binding kinetics, and then can engage additional receptors with a propensity proportional to their affinity ([@fig:bindingS]A). This model then enables us to predict the binding outcome for immune complexes formed from mixtures of antibodies, and ask whether these mixtures have distinct properties from either single-antibody complex ([@fig:bindingS]B). We defined synergy or antagonism in the mixture's effects as a difference from the additive combination of each single antibody case.

With this model, we could identify predicted cases of synergistic or antagonistic binding or predicted effector response in effector cells ([@fig:bindingS]D/E). Responses generally deviated from additivity at higher concentrations and valency of immune complexes ([@fig:bindingS]F/G). This trend is consistent with the observation that non-additive interactions do not arise in the limit of small amounts of receptor binding (TODO). As expected, we observed little effect of proportional variation in receptor abundance ([@fig:bindingS]H). In total, this expanded model of antibody-FcγR interaction allows us to predict whether antibodies might have similar or distinct effects when present in combination.

### An updated regression approach to predicting in vivo effector cell-elicited clearance

To explore how effector cell binding leads to target cell killing, we reimplemented our previous model of antibody-elicited melanoma cell clearance. Building upon our earlier implementation, we refined how uncertainty is handled in the regression between binding and target cell clearance. Briefly, we calculate an "activity" based on the calculated amount of multimerized activating and inhibitory FcγR with each treatment. This is then regressed against each treatment's observed target cell depletion ([@fig:melanoma]A). Target cell depletion is a saturable process (one cannot get rid of more than 100% of cells) and so we previously used a `tanh` relationship to account for this effect [@pmid:29960887].

### A multivalent binding model predicts effector cell-elicited platelet depletion

Having successfully refined our model of antibody-mediated melanoma clearance, we sought to evaluate the generalizability of our model for predicting other examples of antibody-mediated clearance. Injection of XXX antibody which binds to platelets and leads to ADCP serves as a model of ITP. Similarly to our model of melanoma, we regressed predicted immune complex formation and binding against effector cell-elicited platelet clearance.

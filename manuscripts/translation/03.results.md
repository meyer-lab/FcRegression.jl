### A multivalent binding model quantifies potential for synergy in immune complex binding

![**A multivalent binding model quantifies potential for synergy in immune complex binding.** A) Schematic of the multivalent binding model. B) Schematic of how synergy or antagonism is calculated from binding predictions. C) Example of predicted synergy in IC. D) Example of predicted synergy in cMO activity. E) Grid of calculated synergy quantities for all pairs of IgG with murine cMO. F) Calculated synergy values with changes in IC concentration. Each point represents an individual IgG pair. Receptor expression assumed to be that measured for murine cMO. G) Calculated synergy values with variation in IC valency. Conditions match those used in (F). H) Calculated synergy values with proportional variation in receptor expression. Conditions match those used in (F).](./output/figureB1.svg "Figure 1"){#fig:bindingS width="100%"}

### Synergy in effector response need not arise through synergy in binding

![**ITP regression.** A) XXX. B) & E) Quantified platelet depletion in a murine ITP model with matched conditions of FcγR knockout and Fc domain composition; each schematic uses an exponential or gompertz survival mode respectively. The R^2 values are determined through directly predicting the depletion (devar), and predicting the depletion through cross-validation (cevar). C) & F) Quantified cell activities with each survival mode. D) & G) Target cell depletion cleared by cell type with each survival mode. Different IgG subclasses induced target cell depletion to varying extents.](./output/figureB2.svg "Figure 2"){#fig:ITP width="100%"}

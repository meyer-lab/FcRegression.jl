### Profiling the binding effects of mixed-composition immune complexes

To determine the effect of having multiple Fc forms present within an immune complex (IC), we started with a controlled and simplified _in vitro_ system. Like in previous work, we employed a panel of CHO cell lines expressing one of six individual hFcγRs [@pmid:23509345; @pmid:29960887]. ICs were formed by immobilizing anti-2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) IgG on BSA-TNP complexes having an average valency of 4 or 33 (Fig. {@fig:mixBind}A). Binding was then quantified after incubation with the cells, using a constant IC concentration of 1 nM. Unlike our previous work using a single IgG isotype, we assembled ICs from mixtures of each pair of hIgG isotype. Combinations of hFcγRs, IgG pairs, and valency resulted in 72 distinct experimental conditions (Fig. {@fig:S1}).

Inspection of the resulting binding data revealed several expected patterns. Among the conditions with only one IgG present, a strong correlation exists between binding amount and the affinity of IgG-FcγR interaction [@pmid:19018092] (Fig. {@fig:mixBind}B). The higher valency ICs universally showed greater binding signal compared to their matching lower-valency counterparts (Fig. {@fig:mixBind}C). Finally, mixtures between isotype extremes showed a monotonic shift with composition (Fig. {@fig:S1}). These patterns, along with their reproducibility (Fig. {@fig:mixBind}D), gave us confidence in the quality of the binding measurements.

To better visualize the binding measurements, we performed principal component analysis (PCA), with each IgG dose given the isotype mixture and valency as a sample and each receptor as a feature, and technical replicates averaged. We found that two components can explain almost 90% of the variance (Fig. {@fig:mixBind}E). STILL TO BE DETERMINED.

A few unexpected trends were observed among the binding measurements as well. We observed appreciable binding from IgG2-FcγRI interactions, despite this combination being reported as non-binding [@pmid:19018092] (Fig. {@fig:mixBind}F). We also saw an increase in binding with transition from IgG4 to IgG1 with FcγRIIIA-158F, even though these two isotypes are documented to have identical affinity [@pmid:19018092] (Fig. {@fig:mixBind}G). These two observations are consistent with our completely independent, previous binding measurements using this same system [@pmid:29960887]. Each of the affinities involved is very weak, and avidity is a well-known strategy to quantify weak interactions more robustly. Therefore, these binding patterns likely reflect differences in affinity that could not be accurately quantified due to their weak interactions in monovalent form [@pmid:19018092]. 

In all, these data support that a TNP-based IC system provides a controlled _in vitro_ system in which we can profile the effects of mixed IC composition on binding to effector cell populations. Quantifying binding using ICs may in fact provide more precise quantification of IgG-FcγR interaction kinetics, particularly when the interactions are lower affinity.

### A multivalent binding model accurately accounts for _in vitro_ binding of IgG mixtures

To model the effects of polyclonal antibody responses, we extended a simple, equilibrium binding model we previously used to model antibody effector response [@pmid:29960887; @DOI:10.1101/2021.03.10.434776]. Briefly, immune complexes are assumed to bind to FcγRs on the cell surface with monovalent binding kinetics, and then can engage additional receptors with a propensity proportional to their affinity ({@fig:model}A). Though additional assumptions are not required for modeling ICs of mixed isotype composition, this extension leads to a combinatorial expansion in the number of binding configurations. Through some properties of combinatorics, we derived simplified expressions for many macroscopic quantities to allow this model to scale to multi-ligand, multi-receptor, multivalent situations [@DOI:10.1101/2021.03.10.434776].

We fit this model to the binding data and saw reasonable agreement overall ({@fig:model}B). To simplify comparison of the model and binding measurements, we plotted just the conditions with a single IgG isotype present, and saw similar agreement compared to our earlier study ({@fig:model}C) [@pmid:29960887]. The fit parameters of the model also showed close agreement to those we observed previously (see methods). Finally, many of the most discordant values between model and experiment were those for which we noted our input affinity values may be unreliable (TODO ADD EXAMPLES). These observations gave us confidence that the model was an accurate representation of _in vitro_ IC binding.

This model then enables us to predict the IC-cell interactions formed from new IC complexes and ask whether IgG mixtures have distinct properties from either single-antibody complex. Like the binding data itself, our model indicated generally a monotonic relationship in binding when varying the IgG composition of ICs (Fig. {@fig:S1}). However, by simulating the effect of varying one IgG’s affinity, we could observe that higher affinity IgGs contribute to binding to lower percentages of an IC’s composition ({@fig:model}D). Though more difficult to measure, a theoretical model allows for inspection of other quantities, such as clustering of FcγR. This is important because FcγR-elicited effector responses generally occur in response to clustering-mediated activation, rather than IC binding (CITE). Clustering is biphasic with respect to binding due to depletion of receptor at high amounts of binding [@pmid:29960887], and we could observe that this effect should occur with mixed composition ICs as well ({@fig:model}E), leading to distinct behavior of mixed ICs from those with a single IgG isotype.

### Regression unveils receptor and cell type functionality in disease models

We next sought to link the binding of mixed composition ICs to their effects on cellular clearance in vivo. Though antibody-mediated protection operates through a multitude of mechanisms, certain patterns have been recognized and have been useful for optimizing therapeutic benefit [CITE]. In previous work, we showed that IC binding can be accurately linked to overall in vivo effect through a regression framework that weights the importance of specific effector cell populations. We employed a similar approach in linking ICs of mixed composition.

In the process of extending our previous model, we identified several opportunities for improvement. To account for the limited range of cell depletion effects—one cannot deplete an antibody target more than 100% or less than 0%—we used a sigmoidal (tanh) non-linear link function. While many functions provide this general relationship, we realized that the extent of target cell depletion can be thought of as a form of survival analysis. In other words, given a certain antibody activity, a target cell has a certain probability of being cleared within the given timescale of the experiment. Assuming all target cells have an equal propensity of being cleared dictates an exponential relationship for the link function [CITE] (FIG). This observation also guides alternative constructions, such as assuming an additive or multiplicative increase or decrease in the difficulty of cell clearance, which could account for heterogeneity in the target cells [CITE]. Reimplementing our previous experimental system in which melanoma cells are targeted with a TA99 antibody, and clearance from the lung is quantified, we observed that the exponential relationship enabled more accurate prediction on cross validation and inference of effector cell activity on bootstrapping (FIG).

Having refined the cell clearance model, we wished to explore the generalizability of this approach. We therefore implemented an alternative prediction of platelet depletion after 6A6 antibody administration using alternative isotypes and cell depletions (FIG) [CITE]. Initially, we observed worse prediction of depletion effects, particularly for a FcγRIIB knockout condition (FIG). Briefly, as in previous work, we translated IC binding to FcγR activity by summing all activating FcγR found in multi-receptor clusters and subtracting that from the quantity of clustered inhibitory FcγRIIB. The individual observations from the ITP experiments indicated this would be inaccurate. For example, IgG1 administration leads to increased platelet depletion in the background of FcγRIIB knockout, arguing against an inhibitory role of this receptor in this context (FIG).

To resolve this model discrepancy, we instead allowed the activities of each FcγR to vary as a new parameter within the model. Within the melanoma cell depletion experiments, each receptor activity remained close to those previously assumed (FIG). By contrast, FcγRIIB was inferred to have an activating role in platelet depletion (FIG). This led us to expect that there might be context-dependent roles for the FcgR in effector response, and these differences are reflected in each model, and specifically FcγRIIB might play an activating role in platelet depletion with 6A6 antibody. More generally, these results indicated that an effector cell weighting regression scheme can accurately predict antibody-elicited responses in multiple contexts.

### Analyze synergistic effects in IgG mixture mechanism

- Brief introduction on how synergy can potentially arise
- Various isobolograms BINDING TO ONE CELL TYPE, ACT of 1 cell type, and predicted depletion of ITP, (bind to one FcγR, predicted activity, predicted depletion)

With this model, we could identify predicted cases of synergistic or antagonistic binding or predicted effector response in effector cells ([@fig:synergy]D/E). Responses generally deviated from additivity at higher concentrations and valency of immune complexes ([@fig:synergy]F/G). This trend is consistent with the observation that non-additive interactions do not arise in the limit of small amounts of receptor binding (TODO). As expected, we observed little effect of proportional variation in receptor abundance ([@fig:synergy]H). In total, this expanded model of antibody-FcγR interaction allows us to predict whether antibodies might have similar or distinct effects when present in combination.

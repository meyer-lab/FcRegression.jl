### IgG subclass mixtures exhibit synergistic effects in FcγR binding

- Introduction to IgG subclasses
- Introduction of in vitro mixture binding experiment

Analogous to previous work, we assessed the binding of ICs presenting two of four hIgG subclasses to cells expressing one of six hFcγRs at a single IC concentration of $1 \, \mathrm{nM}$. These binding measurements utilized a panel of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, each stably expressing a single hFcγR species. While the IC concentration stayed the same, the binding measurements were taken from ICs developed with various hIgG mixture compositions: 0%, 10%, 33%, 66%, 90%, and 100% of IgGx. This process was performed for ICs with average valencies of both 4 and 33, assembled by covalently attaching 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) to BSA (see STAR Methods). Anti-TNP antibody mixtures of differing hIgG subclasses were bound to the BSA complexes before treatment. The measured binding and variation in binding followed consistent patterns with variation as a function of hIgG subclass, mixture composition, hFcγR, and valency [@DOI:10.4049/jimmunol.1200501].

### A multivalent binding model accurately accounts for in vitro binding of IgG mixtures

- Introduction of the computational model

To model the effects of polyclonal antibody responses, we extended a simple, equilibrium binding model we previously used to model antibody effector response [@pmid:29960887; @DOI:10.1101/2021.03.10.434776]. Briefly, immune complexes are assumed to bind to FcγRs on the cell surface with monovalent binding kinetics, and then can engage additional receptors with a propensity proportional to their affinity ({@fig:model}A). This model then enables us to predict the binding outcome for immune complexes formed from mixtures of antibodies, and ask whether these mixtures have distinct properties from either single-antibody complex ({@fig:model}B).

### Regression unveils receptor and cell type functionality in disease models

- Introduce the target cell clearance experiment

Having successfully refined our model of antibody-mediated melanoma clearance, we sought to evaluate the generalizability of our model for predicting other examples of antibody-mediated clearance. Injection of XXX antibody which binds to platelets and leads to ADCP serves as a model of ITP. Similarly to our model of melanoma, we regressed predicted immune complex formation and binding against effector cell-elicited platelet clearance.

- Introduce the regression model

To explore how effector cell binding leads to target cell killing, we reimplemented our previous model of antibody-elicited melanoma cell clearance. Building upon our earlier implementation, we refined how uncertainty is handled in the regression between binding and target cell clearance. Briefly, we calculate an "activity" based on the calculated amount of multimerized activating and inhibitory FcγR with each treatment. This is then regressed against each treatment's observed target cell depletion ([@fig:regression]a). Target cell depletion is a saturable process (one cannot get rid of more than 100% of cells) and so we previously used a `tanh` relationship to account for this effect [@pmid:29960887].

### Analyze synergistic effects in IgG mixture mechanism

- Brief introduction on how synergy can potentially arise
- Various isobolograms BINDING TO ONE CELL TYPE, ACT of 1 cell type, and predicted depletion of ITP, (bind to one FcγR, predicted activity, predicted depletion)

With this model, we could identify predicted cases of synergistic or antagonistic binding or predicted effector response in effector cells ([@fig:synergy]D/E). Responses generally deviated from additivity at higher concentrations and valency of immune complexes ([@fig:synergy]F/G). This trend is consistent with the observation that non-additive interactions do not arise in the limit of small amounts of receptor binding (TODO). As expected, we observed little effect of proportional variation in receptor abundance ([@fig:synergy]H). In total, this expanded model of antibody-FcγR interaction allows us to predict whether antibodies might have similar or distinct effects when present in combination.

- Analyze synergy in binding, cell activity, and overall depletion (Do we have cytokine secretion data?)

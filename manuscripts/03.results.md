### Profiling the binding effects of mixed-composition immune complexes

To determine the effect of having multiple Fc forms present within an immune complex (IC), we started with a controlled and simplified _in vitro_ system. Like in previous work, we employed a panel of CHO cell lines expressing one of six individual hFcγRs [@PMID:23509345; @PMID: 29960887]. ICs were formed by immobilizing anti-2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) IgG on BSA-TNP complexes having an average valency of 4 or 33 (Fig. {@fig: mixBind}A). Binding was then quantified after incubation with the cells, using a constant IC concentration of 1 nM. Unlike our previous work using a single IgG isotype, we assembled ICs from mixtures of hIgG isotypes. Combinations of hFcγRs, IgG mixtures, and valency resulted in XXX distinct experimental conditions.

Inspection of the resulting binding data revealed several expected patterns. Among the conditions with only one IgG present, a strong correlation exists between binding amount and the affinity of IgG-FcγR interaction [@PMID: 19018092] (Fig. {@fig: mixBind}). The higher valency ICs universally showed greater binding signal compared to their matching lower-valency counterparts (Fig. {@fig: mixBind}). Finally, mixtures between isotype extremes showed a monotonic shift with composition (Fig. {@fig: mixBind}). These patterns, along with their reproducibility (Fig. {@fig: mixBind}), gave us confidence in the quality of the binding measurements.

A few unexpected trends were observed among the binding measurements as well. We observed appreciable binding from IgG2-FcγRI interactions, despite this combination being reported as non-binding [@PMID:19018092] (Fig. {@fig: mixBind}). Similarly, we saw an increase in binding with transition from IgG4 to IgG1 with FcγRIIIA-158F, even though these two isotypes are documented to have identical affinity [@PMID:19018092] (Fig. {@fig: mixBind}). These two observations are consistent with our completely independent, previous binding measurements using this same system [@PMID:29960887]. Each of the affinities involved is very weak, and avidity is a well-known strategy to quantify weak interactions more robustly. Therefore, these binding patterns likely reflect differences in affinity that could not be accurately quantified due to their weak interactions in monovalent form [@PMID:19018092]. In all, these data support that a TNP-based IC system provides a controlled _in vitro_ system in which we can profile the effects of mixed IC composition on binding to effector cell populations.

### A multivalent binding model accurately accounts for _in vitro_ binding of IgG mixtures

- Introduction of the computational model

To model the effects of polyclonal antibody responses, we extended a simple, equilibrium binding model we previously used to model antibody effector response [@pmid:29960887; @DOI:10.1101/2021.03.10.434776]. Briefly, immune complexes are assumed to bind to FcγRs on the cell surface with monovalent binding kinetics, and then can engage additional receptors with a propensity proportional to their affinity ({@fig:model}A). This model then enables us to predict the binding outcome for immune complexes formed from mixtures of antibodies, and ask whether these mixtures have distinct properties from either single-antibody complex ({@fig:model}B).

### Regression unveils receptor and cell type functionality in disease models

- Introduce the target cell clearance experiment

Having successfully refined our model of antibody-mediated melanoma clearance, we sought to evaluate the generalizability of our model for predicting other examples of antibody-mediated clearance. Injection of XXX antibody which binds to platelets and leads to ADCP serves as a model of ITP. Similarly to our model of melanoma, we regressed predicted immune complex formation and binding against effector cell-elicited platelet clearance.

- Introduce the regression model

To explore how effector cell binding leads to target cell killing, we reimplemented our previous model of antibody-elicited melanoma cell clearance. Building upon our earlier implementation, we refined how uncertainty is handled in the regression between binding and target cell clearance. Briefly, we calculate an "activity" based on the calculated amount of multimerized activating and inhibitory FcγR with each treatment. This is then regressed against each treatment's observed target cell depletion ([@fig:regression]a). Target cell depletion is a saturable process (one cannot get rid of more than 100% of cells) and so we previously used a `tanh` relationship to account for this effect [@pmid:29960887].

### Analyze synergistic effects in IgG mixture mechanism

- Brief introduction on how synergy can potentially arise
- Various isobolograms BINDING TO ONE CELL TYPE, ACT of 1 cell type, and predicted depletion of ITP, (bind to one FcγR, predicted activity, predicted depletion)

With this model, we could identify predicted cases of synergistic or antagonistic binding or predicted effector response in effector cells ([@fig:synergy]D/E). Responses generally deviated from additivity at higher concentrations and valency of immune complexes ([@fig:synergy]F/G). This trend is consistent with the observation that non-additive interactions do not arise in the limit of small amounts of receptor binding (TODO). As expected, we observed little effect of proportional variation in receptor abundance ([@fig:synergy]H). In total, this expanded model of antibody-FcγR interaction allows us to predict whether antibodies might have similar or distinct effects when present in combination.

# IgG immune complexes were generated with anti-TNP mouse IgG1,, IgG2b or IgG2c and TNP-33-BSA as antigen. ,,,,,
# 10Âµg/ml of immune complexes were incubated with 100,,000 CHO cells stably expressing murine FcgRI, FcgRIIb, FcgRIII or FcgRIV for 1h gently shaking on ice.,,,
# Bound immune complexes were detected by staining with PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgG F(ab)2.,,,,,,,
# Cells were analysed on a FACSCantoII (BD BioSciences).,,,,,,,
# Experiments were conducted by Daniela Kao,,,,,,,

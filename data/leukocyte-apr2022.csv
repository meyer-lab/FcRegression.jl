# IgG immune complexes were generated with anti-TNP mouse IgG1,, IgG2b or IgG2c and TNP-4-BSA or TNP-33-BSA as antigen. ,,,,
# 10Âµg/ml of immune complexes were incubated with 200,,000 spleen cells isolated from C57BL/6 mice for 1h gently shaking on ice.,,,,
# Bound immune complexes were detected by staining with PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgG F(ab)2 on leukocyte populations identified by specific surface marker expression.,,,,,,
# Cells were analysed on a FACSCantoII (BD BioSciences).,,,,,,
